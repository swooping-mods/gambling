# Credits Gambling

Ctrl+G wagers a small amount of virtual game credits.

## Install

Install [Moon Sweepers Mod Loader](https://github.com/swooping-mods/moon-sweepers-mod-loader) first.

Download [gambling-0.1.0.msmod](content/gambling-0.1.0.msmod), import it with **Install mod package**, then select the mod and its required frameworks.

## Controls

- Ctrl+G wagers a small amount of virtual game credits.
- Gameplay testing is deferred; use a disposable Steam-only world.

## Compatibility

Version 0.1.0. Targets the pinned Steam Windows x64 IL2CPP build of Moon Sweepers (Steam app 5335510). On Linux, the game runs through Proton. Experimental: back up saves before using save-affecting mods.

## Build

Run `python3 build.py --check` to verify source hashes, then `python3 build.py` to write a build under `.local/build/`. Requires installed Clang, lld-link and llvm-dlltool.
